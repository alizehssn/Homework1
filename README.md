# Homework1: Horiseon Marketing
The html and css provided had a few errors that needed to be edited. I added a reset CSS to the head and corrected the href for the stylesheet. In addition i changed the padding. The content also was changed to div id's in order to make the header list clickable. Alt tags were added to all images as well.
